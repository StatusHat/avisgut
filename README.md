Realistic remake of the classic

The original hit game, Paperboy, misrepresented most everything about delivering
newspapers. 

This remake is dedicated to all the kids who, for minimum wage, 
toiled away in dark streets while trying to avoid angry senior citizens in 
smelly stairwells or angry dogs or bratty brats.

Might be created with Godot
